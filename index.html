								<p> the best tips about how to take care of your dog</p>
								<p>The first ingredient in your dog's food should be a specified meat.  Not a meat by-product, but the real thing. Puppies and adult dogs were not meant to eat corn and wheat. If the first ingredient in your dog food is a corn, wheat, meat by-product, bone meal or anything but a real specified type of meat, steer clear. By-products are the leftovers, such as the eyes, hooves, skin, feathers and feet, that are not good for human consumption (unless the dog food specifically states otherwise.) Beware of ingredients that do not list exactly what it is, such as words like "animal" and "meat" as opposed to "chicken," "beef," "duck," etc. See Rendered Products in Dog Food.</p>

								<h2>History about Dogs<br />
								How they where made</h2>
								<p> Did you now that all camefrom the grey wolf.</p>
								<p>Dogs are a kind of wolf. They were the first animals that people fed on purpose, earlier than sheep or cows or chickens. People have been taking care of dogs in Central Asia since about 13,000 BC, in the Stone Age, before the beginning of farming (and possibly much earlier; maybe as long as 100,000 years ago, before people left Africa). Most likely, dogs themselves began this relationship by hanging around people's campsites (there weren't any villages yet), trying to snatch some of their garbage to eat. At first, people must have tried to scare the dogs away. But after a while, some of them realized that the dogs ate rats, and also helped to clean up food garbage that drew flies and other insects. So campsites with dogs were cleaner and healthier than campsites without dogs. Fewer people got dysentery and died.</p>

								<h2>Best treats for Dogs<br />
								</h2>
								<p> Iam going to tell you what are the best treat for dogs.</p>
								<p>A dog treat should be just that – something special which you give as a reward. Healthy treats for dogs come in all shapes, sizes, and flavours but not all are nutritionally equal, with some snacks being better than others.

<p>Modern training techniques depend largely on reward-based learning, and so treats are part of everyday life for most dogs. This makes it’s even more important that you chose healthy treats so you don’t accidentally load up the dog with preservatives, colouring, artificial flavourings, or low quality soya.</p>
